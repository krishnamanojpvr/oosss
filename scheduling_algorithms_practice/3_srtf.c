/* 3. Imagine an Emergency Medical Dispatch Center (EMDC) tasked with coordinating emergency medical responses across a large urban area. The center receives calls about various emergenciesâ€”accidents, medical crises, and urgent patient transfers. Identify the algorithm helps prioritize shorter-duration tasks, allowing the center to quickly dispatch assistance for multiple emergencies, potentially saving more lives by reducing the response time.
Task Simulation:
Here are some examples of calls received by the EMDC one morning:
1.	Call A - Rapid response for a cardiac arrest at a home: Initial Burst Time = 7 minutes, Arrival Time = 08:00 AM
2.	Call B - Ambulance dispatch for a minor car accident: Initial Burst Time = 5 minutes, Arrival Time = 08:01 AM
3.	Call C - Coordinate a helicopter for a critical transfer from a rural area: Initial Burst Time = 3 minutes, Arrival Time = 08:02 AM
4.	Call D - Send paramedics to a multiple injury accident on a highway: Initial Burst Time = 20 minutes, Arrival Time = 08:15 AM
5.	Call E - Dispatch an ambulance for a sudden stroke case: Initial Burst Time = 10 minutes, Arrival Time = 08:20 AM

// Identify the type of CPU scheduling algorithm for the scenario and implement the same in C Language. Calculate Average Turn Around time and Average Waiting time for each of the scheduling algorithm by taking arrival times accordingly.
// Calculate the times by using gantt chart in observation and crosscheck the same with the output of the program.
