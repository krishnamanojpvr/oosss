/* 4. Airlines categorize passengers into different groups based on various criteria such as frequent flyer status, class of service, special needs, and more. Each group is assigned a priority level, and within that priority, boarding is handled in the order that passengers arrive at the gate
•	Priority Assignment:
1.	First Priority: First-class passengers, high-tier frequent flyers, and passengers requiring special assistance (e.g., wheelchair users).Arrival time: 3 and assistance time: 5min
2.	Second Priority: Business class and mid-tier frequent flyers. Arrival time: 0 and assistance time: 10min
3.	Third Priority: Premium economy passengers. Arrival time: 4 and assistance time: 7min
4.	Fourth Priority: Economy class passengers. Arrival time: 1 and assistance time: 8min
5.	Final Priority: Basic economy or last-minute ticket purchasers, Arrival time: 5 and assistance time: 6min
