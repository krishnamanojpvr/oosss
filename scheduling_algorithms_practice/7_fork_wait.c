/* 7.Assume you own a small community bookstore that regularly needs to update its inventory records at the end of the business day. The inventory update is divided into two main tasks: tallying sales and restocking items. Due to the store's unique cataloging system, these tasks need to be handled sequentially. Create a simple application that uses UNIX/Linux processes, to separate the tallying of sales from the restocking of items.
Expected Output:
Parent Output: "Daily sales tallied successfully."
Child Output: "Items restocked based on sales data."
Final Output by Parent: "Inventory update complete."*/
